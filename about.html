                    <p class="entry e-1">
                        I’ve always had an affinity for numbers. Since I can remember, math and its applications
                        were always the topics I would gravitate to most in school. As a result, here at Penn
                        (where I’m in the process of finishing my senior year), I decided to double major in
                        systems engineering and economics with minors in math and data science. Of particular
                        interest are research papers and problems relating to international finance, theory of networks,
                        artificial intelligence, and systems dynamics.

                        . . . and the less serious stuff
                    </p>
                    <p class="entry e-2">
                        I was born and raised in the DC area and currently live in Philadelphia. As you may
                        have been able to tell, I really like music. I love both listening to my favorite
                        songs and spending hours finding new ones. This naturally lead me to becoming a DJ
                        on my spare time. I’m also a big fan of photography and recently got in to shooting
                        film. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my undying love and
                        support for my favorite soccer team - Real Madrid C.F.
